S"in 1977, one of east germany's best sprinters, renate neufeld, fled to the west with the bulgarian she later married. a year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent east germany in the 1980 olympic games.   at 17, i joined the east berlin sports institute. my speciality was the 80m hurdles. we swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods, including our parents. the training was very hard. we were all watched. we signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return. one day, my trainer, g\xc3\xbcnter clam, advised me to take pills to improve my performance: i was running 200m in 24 seconds. my trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but i soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes i couldn't talk any more. then i started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. i then refused to take these pills. one morning in october 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. i then decided to flee, with my fianc\xc3\xa9 [ref].   she brought with her to the west grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. the west german doping analyst manfred donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids"
